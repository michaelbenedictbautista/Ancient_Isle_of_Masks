Basic Game Engine project
The project is based from the game called the Defense Of The Ancients. A hero named Yurnero, the Juggernaut which drowned in the Isle of Masks, will 
carry the customary observances characteristic of the faceless ones for vengeance. During game, enemies also known as creeps are constantly moving horizontally and 
vertically. Whilst player will control the hero named Yurnero. Players are given three life chances and each collision will result to decrease of life. Players
